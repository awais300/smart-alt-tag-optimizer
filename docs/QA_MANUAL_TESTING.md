- [ ] Test scope: "WooCommerce Products Only" (if WooCommerce active)
- [ ] Verify correct items processed in each

### 4. Frontend Output Buffering (SEO)

**Test 4.1: Server-Side Injection**
- [ ] Set injection method to "Server-side Buffer"
- [ ] Create post with image missing alt
- [ ] View post on frontend
- [ ] Inspect HTML source: verify `alt="..."` present in `<img>` tags
- [ ] Check that alt matches configured source
- [ ] Verify no performance degradation (TTFB ~same as before)

**Test 4.2: Caching**
- [ ] View post 3 times
- [ ] Check database query count: should be similar (cached)
- [ ] Modify post content
- [ ] Clear cache (Settings > Clear HTML Cache)
- [ ] Verify cache is regenerated

**Test 4.3: Skip Buffering Conditions**
- [ ] Set injection method to "Server-side Buffer"
- [ ] Access RSS feed: should NOT buffer
- [ ] Access post preview: should buffer (optional, depends on settings)
- [ ] Access category/search page: should NOT buffer (not singular)

### 5. WooCommerce Integration (If Installed)

**Test 5.1: Product Featured Image**
- [ ] Create WooCommerce product "Blue Shirt"
- [ ] Upload featured image
- [ ] Publish product
- [ ] Verify featured image alt = "Blue Shirt" (or product name)

**Test 5.2: Product Gallery**
- [ ] Add 2 images to product gallery
- [ ] Publish/update
- [ ] Verify both gallery images have alt set to product name
- [ ] Check no duplicate processing (deduplication working)

**Test 5.3: Product Description HTML**

- [ ] Save product
- [ ] Verify inline image alt processed

### 6. Logging & Audit Trail

**Test 6.1: View Logs**
- [ ] Navigate to Logs & Stats tab
- [ ] Verify statistics card shows: Total Logged, AI Generated, Errors, Last Run
- [ ] View log table: columns include Time, Attachment, Source, Old Alt, New Alt, Status

**Test 6.2: Revert Entry**
- [ ] Find a successful log entry with "old_alt" populated
- [ ] Click "Revert" button
- [ ] Verify attachment alt reverted to old value
- [ ] New log entry created with status "reverted"

**Test 6.3: Log Pruning**
- [ ] Set log retention to 7 days
- [ ] Manually run pruning (if button available) or wait for cron
- [ ] Verify old logs deleted
- [ ] Recent logs retained

**Test 6.4: Log Level Filtering**
- [ ] Set log level to "errors only"
- [ ] Run post save: should not log success
- [ ] Trigger error (disconnect AI): should log
- [ ] Verify logs list shows only errors

### 7. Security Tests

**Test 7.1: Nonce Verification**
- [ ] Attempt AJAX request without nonce: should fail
- [ ] Attempt bulk update as non-admin user: should fail
- [ ] Verify capability checks enforced

**Test 7.2: Sanitization**
- [ ] Enter malicious alt text in settings (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`)
- [ ] Save and view: should be sanitized (no script tags)
- [ ] Check database: raw value should not contain code

**Test 7.3: API Key Security**
- [ ] Set API key via environment variable `SMARTALT_AI_KEY`
- [ ] Verify settings page shows "Using environment variable"
- [ ] Verify key never exposed in HTML or logs
- [ ] Export database: ensure key is encrypted or not present

### 8. Performance Tests

**Test 8.1: TTFB Impact**
- [ ] Disable plugin, measure TTFB on typical post: baseline
- [ ] Enable plugin with server-side buffering, measure TTFB: should be â‰¤5ms slower
- [ ] Disable buffering: should be near-zero impact

**Test 8.2: Database Queries**
- [ ] With buffering enabled, view post: count queries
- [ ] View same post again: should use cache (fewer queries)
- [ ] Modify post: cache invalidated, new queries

**Test 8.3: Memory Usage**
- [ ] Monitor PHP memory on bulk update with 500 items
- [ ] Should not exceed 64MB allocated
- [ ] Batch processing should keep memory stable

### 9. Multisite Tests (If Applicable)

**Test 9.1: Per-Site Settings**
- [ ] Set different alt source per site (Site A: Post Title, Site B: AI)
- [ ] Create posts on each site
- [ ] Verify settings respected per-site

- [ ] Check logs: include site_id

### 10. Error Handling

**Test 10.1: AI API Timeout**
- [ ] Set AI endpoint to unreachable URL
- [ ] Try to generate alt via AI
- [ ] Should fallback to post_title gracefully
- [ ] Should log error

**Test 10.2: Malformed JSON Response**
- [ ] Mock AI endpoint returning invalid JSON
- [ ] Process post
- [ ] Should handle gracefully, log error
- [ ] Post should not fail

**Test 10.3: Missing Configuration**
- [ ] Delete all settings
- [ ] Try to use plugin
- [ ] Should use sensible defaults or disable gracefully
